A simple To-Do List application made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\
\
This was made to broaden my knowledge of these languages, and to gain some more experience with creating a project.\
\
The application allows the user to:\
Input a name, and after this greets them with either Good Morning or Good Afternoon depending on the time of day,\
Add tasks,\
Check off tasks,\
Delete tasks,\
Get information on the current weather (requires OpenWeatherAPI API key, which isn't included in the repo),\
Clear all tasks with a single button,\
Auto save, and manually save with the 's' key.\
\
Here is a video showing off the application, as well as showing the weather API functionality.\
